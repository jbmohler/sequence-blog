## The Square Numbers

One of the simplest integer sequences we can imagine is the sequence $1, 4, 9,
16, 25, ...$ of the perfect squares.  We now look at a variation of this sequence.

Here are the perfect squares up to $20^2$.

$$
\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}1\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}4\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}9\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}16\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}25
\hspace{.1in}2\hspace{.1in}36\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}49\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}64\hspace{.1in}\hspace{.1in}81\hspace{.1in}100
\hspace{.1in}2121\hspace{.1in}144\hspace{.1in}169\hspace{.1in}196\hspace{.1in}225
\hspace{.1in}2256\hspace{.1in}289\hspace{.1in}324\hspace{.1in}361\hspace{.1in}400
$$

Observe that the final digits of each of these numbers is:

$$
1\hspace{.3in}4\hspace{.3in}9\hspace{.3in}6\hspace{.3in}5\hspace{.3in}6\hspace{.3in}9\hspace{.3in}4\hspace{.3in}1\hspace{.3in}0
\hspace{.3in}41\hspace{.3in}4\hspace{.3in}9\hspace{.3in}6\hspace{.3in}5\hspace{.3in}6\hspace{.3in}9\hspace{.3in}4\hspace{.3in}1\hspace{.3in}0
$$

## Squares mod 10

The second sequence (the one with the single digits) above are the sequence of
remainders when dividing the perfect squares by 10.   Isn't it strange that no
perfect square ends in a $2, 3, 7$ or $8$?  It turns out this is true of the
remainders of the squares when dividing by just about every number --
approximately half of the possible remainders are not represented.
