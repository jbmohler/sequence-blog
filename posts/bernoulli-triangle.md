## A 2-d Sequence

Today's sequence is not a sequence technically, but it is a very important 2
dimensional triangle of numbers with many special properties.  It is known as
the Bernoulli triangle as well as many other more descriptive names.

Each member of the triangle is computed as the sum of the two above to the left
and the right.  The triangle is symmetric left to right.

## Many Sequences

There are a host of sequences in this triangle.  The 3rd diagonal row (down to
the left or the right) is the sequence of triangular numbers.  We'll dig deeper
into the meaning of this triangle in future posts.
