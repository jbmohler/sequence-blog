## A 2-d Sequence

Today's sequence is not a sequence technically, but it is a very important 2
dimensional triangle of numbers with many special properties.  It is known as
the Bernoulli triangle as well as many other more descriptive names.

## Many Sequences

There are a host of sequences in this triangle.  The 3rd diagonal row (down to
the left or the right) is the sequence of triangular numbers.  We'll dig deeper
into the meaning of this triangle in future posts.
