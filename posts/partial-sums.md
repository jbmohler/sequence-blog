# Partial Sums

If one has a sequence of integers, you can generate another sequence of
integers by taking the partial sums.  For instance the positive integers $1, 2,
3, 4, ...$ is a fine sequence.  Yesterdays sequence of triangular numbers was
computed by taking the partial sums of this sequence.

$$
1=1
$$

$$
3=1+2
$$

$$
6=1+2+3
$$

$$
10=1+2+3+4
$$

So the $n^{th}$ triangular number can be said to be the $n^{th}$ partial sum of
the sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, ...$.

# Perfect Cubes

Here is another sequence of integers:  $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...$.  Each number
$a_n$ of the sequence is $n^3$.  What are the partial sums of the cubes?

$$
1=1
$$

$$
9=1+8
$$

$$
36=1+8+27
$$

$$
100=1+8+27+64
$$

What sequence is the sum of the first $n$ perfect cubes?

$$
1, 9, 36, 100, ...
$$

These numbers all are perfect squares!  Is that always the case?  Can we prove
it?  Stay tuned!
