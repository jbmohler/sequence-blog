# This blog

This is a blog about numbers, overwhelmingly simple positive integers.  Beyond
individual numbers, it is a blog about sequences of numbers.  There are so many
ways to think about integers and sequences give us a window to these beauties.

# Our first sequence

The triangular numbers are the numbers $1$, $3$, $6$, $10$, $15$, ...  Each
element of this sequence is formed by adding it's own index to the number
before it.  If we label them $a_1=1$, $a_2=3$, etc, then the formula is
$a_{n}=a_{n-1}+n$.   Alternatively (and equivalently)
\[
a_n=1+2+...+n.
\]

Why are these "triangular" numbers?  If I give you $a_n$ uniformly sized rocks,
you can arrange them on the ground in a triangular pattern with each side of
the triangle being of length $n$.
